# cf-vault

Based on this repo: https://github.com/making/cf-vault

Most of this README deals with deploying Vault to a Cloud foundry environment. If you decide to deploy to a 
non Cloud foundry environment please pay special attention to the `Custom backend` section which describes how
you can configure persistent storage via the environment.

# Storage backends

## PostgreSQL backend

```
$ cf create-service hsdp-rds postgres-micro-dev postgres-vault
```

### Initializing PostgreSQL schema

Vault requires PostgreSQL 9.5 or newer. [Documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/postgresql.html)
The Vault backend plugin doesn't create the schema automatically. Execute below SQL for that:

```
CREATE TABLE vault_kv_store (
  parent_path TEXT COLLATE "C" NOT NULL,
  path        TEXT COLLATE "C",
  key         TEXT COLLATE "C",
  value       BYTEA,
  CONSTRAINT pkey PRIMARY KEY (path, key)
);

CREATE INDEX parent_path_idx ON vault_kv_store (parent_path);
```

## MySQL backend

```
$ cf create-service hsdp-rds mysql-micro-dev mysql-vault
```

# Custom backend

The image will attempt to autodetect bound storage in Cloud foundry (PostgreSQL, MySQL and DynamoDB supported).
If none of the above service types are bound or if you are deploying to a non Cloud Foundry environment you can
pass a storage stanza section in a `STORAGE_STANZA` environment variable.

Documentation on this can be found [here](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration/storage/index.html)

Example for filesystem storage:

```
$ STORAGE_STANZA="storage \"file\" { path = \"/mnt/vault/data\" }" custom_deploy_this.sh
```

# Deploying Vault to CF

## Docker

The preferred way of deployment is using Docker. See the `Dockerfile` for details. First build and publish the docker image to a docker registry. Example push:

```
$ CF_DOCKER_PASSWORD=mypassword cf push vault --docker-image some.docker.rep/vault --docker-username myusername
```

### Using manifest.yml

```
$ cp manifest-example.yml manifest.yml 
```

Change `name` if needed, then

```
$ cf push
```

you can see vault has started successfully as following:

```
$ cf logs cf-vault --recent

```

Now, you can access Vault via like `https://cf-vault.cfapps.io`. Subdomain should be different for your case.

# Initialize vault

```
$ export VAULT_ADDR=https://<your-sub-domain>.cfapps.io
$ vault operator init
```

you'll see five unseal keys and root token

```
Unseal Key 1: w6rUcrlOEd4tI0MNtCYxG2uUoGj8wG9euXm4RiHq7BDh
Unseal Key 2: tkGGsCQJeNyORbz2uRyWjCq03kj/OPtGzmM/Bjv9+RTP
Unseal Key 3: 584Sg15Itt8zJpiJOBh+1IVKp56Hv9FiryiK63dztA7C
Unseal Key 4: +ZqZetBMtslvfKfWJ0uCAup51Z5Qx5qobzVjxwqD2rlz
Unseal Key 5: TFYSjAWOjHBARjXBblZuVovtxNnHnSuuHwBthhym8VxL
Initial Root Token: db2c7fae-7162-d09e-7901-66d47360c62f
```


Unseal Vault with three of five unseal keys, for example:

```
vault operator unseal w6rUcrlOEd4tI0MNtCYxG2uUoGj8wG9euXm4RiHq7BDh
vault operator unseal tkGGsCQJeNyORbz2uRyWjCq03kj/OPtGzmM/Bjv9+RTP
vault operator unseal 584Sg15Itt8zJpiJOBh+1IVKp56Hv9FiryiK63dztA7C
```

Authenticate with the root token, for example:

```
$ vault auth db2c7fae-7162-d09e-7901-66d47360c62f
```

finally, you can read and write Vault :)

```
$ vault write secret/hello value=world
Success! Data written to: secret/hello

$ vault read secret/hello
Key             	Value
---             	-----
refresh_interval	768h0m0s
value           	world
```

## Enable CF Auth Method

This vault instance allows to use CF as the auth provider which is completely token free authentication. For more information about CF as auth provider, please refer to the following plugin repository. 
https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-cf



Use the docker container to find the checksum of the plugin in file /app/checkum and use in the below command to register the plugin with vault
```
vault plugin register \
    -sha256=plugin_checksum \
    auth vault-plugin-auth-cf
```
Followed by this command to enable this auth method
```
vault auth enable vault-plugin-auth-cf
```
As mentioned under the readme of the plugin repo, https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-plugin-auth-cf#sample-usage, continue to configure the vault with the additional configuration for the plugin and setting up policies around it. 

## Unseal when restarting

Because Vault seals when it restarts, you need to unseal automatically in order to keep Vault available in CF environment.

If you set environment variables `VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY1`, `VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY2` and `VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY3`, Vault will be unsealed at startup

Example:

```
$ cf set-env cf-vault VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY1 w6rUcrlOEd4tI0MNtCYxG2uUoGj8wG9euXm4RiHq7BDh
$ cf set-env cf-vault VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY2 tkGGsCQJeNyORbz2uRyWjCq03kj/OPtGzmM/Bjv9+RTP
$ cf set-env cf-vault VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY3 584Sg15Itt8zJpiJOBh+1IVKp56Hv9FiryiK63dztA7
```

**WARNING**: Anyone who has access to your CF ENV will effectively have access to all secrets stored in your Vault if you choose to expose your unseal keys like this.
